					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of today was to further personalize our homepage and to create a local file on my computer and add index.html to my files. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab today was trying to resize my image. It was absolutely gigantic when I first entered it into the index.html. I tried to resize it using css but it wasn't working and I had to look for what my issue was. It turned to be a missing backslash that I didn't see. Other than that I didnt reeally have any huge issues. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I feel a little more confident with using the index.html file. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>You're looking at the file I created!</p>
